#summary a command line shell for the Talis Platform

= Introduction =

{{{pynappl}}} includes a simple command-line utility named {{{tshell}}} that allows the user to manually enter and execute  commands against the [http://www.talis.com/platform Talis Platform]. This document provides a brief introduction on how to use the tshell program. 


= Getting Started =

The {{{tshell}} program can be found in the {{{/bin}}} directory of the pynappl distribution. To start using {{{tshell}}} simply type the name of the program in the console:

{{{
> ./tshell
>>>
}}}

The Talis Platform is organised into areas called [http://n2.talis.com/wiki/Store stores] that group together data and services for accessing it. The majority of {{{tshell}}} commands act on a store. You can set the active store with the {{{use}}} command. For example to set the active store to "space" (i.e. http://api.talis.com/stores/space):

{{{
>>> use space
>>>
}}}

= Exploring a Store =

{{{tshell}} provides several utility commands for exploring the data in a store. These can be useful when you are unfamiliar with a store and want to discover what kind of data it contains. For example, you can see a list of the RDF classes used in the store's metabox:

{{{
>>> use space
>>> show classes
